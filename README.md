This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle issue with Firebase: handling errors related to offline mode or network connectivity problems.  The `offlineError.js` file shows how a Firebase operation might fail silently or produce an unclear error.  The solution, `offlineErrorSolution.js`, demonstrates how to effectively handle these situations using Firebase's offline capabilities and providing meaningful feedback to users.
